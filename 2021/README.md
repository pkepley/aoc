# AOC 2021

Solutions to Advent of Code 2021. In Python this year (again).

To run, create a file `aoc_config.py` in the `programs` directory with a variable `input_path` pointing to your input file folder. Each day's input file should be saved in the input file folder as `input_day_XX.txt` (where `XX` is the two-digit day, with zero-padding as necessary).
