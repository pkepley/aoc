    "## [Day 6](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/6): Memory Reallocation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "A debugger program here is having an issue: it is trying to repair a memory reallocation routine, but it keeps getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this area, there are sixteen memory banks; each memory bank can hold any number of blocks. The goal of the reallocation routine is to balance the blocks between the memory banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reallocation routine operates in cycles. In each cycle, it finds the memory bank with the most blocks (ties won by the lowest-numbered memory bank) and redistributes those blocks among the banks. To do this, it removes all of the blocks from the selected bank, then moves to the next (by index) memory bank and inserts one of the blocks. It continues doing this until it runs out of blocks; if it reaches the last memory bank, it wraps around to the first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The debugger would like to know how many redistributions can be done before a blocks-in-banks configuration is produced that has been seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a scenario with only four memory banks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The banks start with 0, 2, 7, and 0 blocks. The third bank has the most blocks, so it is chosen for redistribution.\n",
    "- Starting with the next bank (the fourth bank) and then continuing to the first bank, the second bank, and so on, the 7 blocks are spread out over the memory banks. The fourth, first, and second banks get two blocks each, and the third bank gets one back. The final result looks like this: 2 4 1 2.\n",
    "- Next, the second bank is chosen because it contains the most blocks (four). Because there are four memory banks, each gets one block. The result is: 3 1 2 3.\n",
    "- Now, there is a tie between the first and fourth memory banks, both of which have three blocks. The first bank wins the tie, and its three blocks are distributed evenly over the other three banks, leaving it with none: 0 2 3 4.\n",
    "- The fourth bank is chosen, and its four blocks are distributed such that each of the four banks receives one: 1 3 4 1.\n",
    "- The third bank is chosen, and the same thing happens: 2 4 1 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we've reached a state we've seen before: 2 4 1 2 was already seen. The infinite loop is detected after the fifth block redistribution cycle, and so the answer in this example is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the initial block counts in your puzzle input, how many redistribution cycles must be completed before a configuration is produced that has been seen before?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of curiosity, the debugger would also like to know the size of the loop: starting from a state that has already been seen, how many block redistribution cycles must be performed before that same state is seen again?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, 2 4 1 2 is seen again after four cycles, and so the answer in that example would be 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many cycles are in the infinite loop that arises from the configuration in your puzzle input?\n"

At the bottom of these sub-towers, standing on the bottom disc, are other programs, each holding their own disc, and so on.

    "Each instruction consists of several parts: the register to modify, whether to increase or decrease that register's value, the amount by which to increase or decrease it, and a condition. If the condition fails, skip the instruction without modifying the register. The registers all start at 0. The instructions look like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "After this process, the largest value in any register is 1.\n",

    "You might also encounter <= (less than or equal to) or != (not equal to). However, the CPU doesn't have the bandwidth to tell you what all the registers are named, and leaves that to you to determine.\n",

    "What is the largest value in any register after completing the instructions in your puzzle input?\n",

    "\n",
    "The logic you've constructed forms a single round of the Knot Hash algorithm; running the full thing requires many of these rounds. Some input and output processing is also required.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, from now on, your input should be taken not as a list of numbers, but as a string of bytes instead. Unless otherwise specified, convert characters to bytes using their ASCII codes. This will allow you to handle arbitrary ASCII strings, and it also ensures that your input lengths are never larger than 255. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, you should convert it to the ASCII codes for each character: 49,44,50,44,51.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have determined the sequence of lengths to use, add the following lengths to the end of the sequence: 17, 31, 73, 47, 23. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, your final sequence of lengths should be 49,44,50,44,51,17,31,73,47,23 (the ASCII codes from the input string combined with the standard length suffix values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, instead of merely running one round like you did above, run a total of 64 rounds, using the same length sequence in each round. The current position and skip size should be preserved between rounds. For example, if the previous example was your first round, you would start your second round with the same length sequence (3, 4, 1, 5, 17, 31, 73, 47, 23, now assuming they came from ASCII codes and include the suffix), but start with the previous round's current position (4) and skip size (4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the rounds are complete, you will be left with the numbers from 0 to 255 in some order, called the sparse hash. Your next task is to reduce these to a list of only 16 numbers called the dense hash. To do this, use numeric bitwise XOR to combine each consecutive block of 16 numbers in the sparse hash (there are 16 such blocks in a list of 256 numbers). So, the first element in the dense hash is the first sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, the second element in the dense hash is the second sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the first sixteen elements of your sparse hash are as shown below, and the XOR operator is ^, you would calculate the first output number like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "65 ^ 27 ^ 9 ^ 1 ^ 4 ^ 3 ^ 40 ^ 50 ^ 91 ^ 7 ^ 6 ^ 0 ^ 2 ^ 5 ^ 68 ^ 22 = 64\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform this operation on each of the sixteen blocks of sixteen numbers in your sparse hash to determine the sixteen numbers in your dense hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the standard way to represent a Knot Hash is as a single hexadecimal string; the final output is the dense hash in hexadecimal notation. Because each number in your dense hash will be between 0 and 255 (inclusive), always represent each number as two hexadecimal digits (including a leading zero as necessary). So, if your first three numbers are 64, 7, 255, they correspond to the hexadecimal numbers 40, 07, ff, and so the first six characters of the hash would be 4007ff. Because every Knot Hash is sixteen such numbers, the hexadecimal representation is always 32 hexadecimal digits (0-f) long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some example hashes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The empty string becomes a2582a3a0e66e6e86e3812dcb672a272.\n",
    "    AoC 2017 becomes 33efeb34ea91902bb2f59c9920caa6cd.\n",
    "    1,2,3 becomes 3efbe78a8d82f29979031a4aa0b16a9d.\n",

    "Walking along the memory banks of the stream, you find a small village that is experiencing a little confusion: some programs can't communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs in this village communicate using a fixed system of pipes. Messages are passed between programs using these pipes, but most programs aren't connected to each other directly. Instead, programs pass messages between each other until the message reaches the intended recipient.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some reason, though, some of these messages aren't ever reaching their intended recipient, and the programs suspect that some pipes are missing. They would like you to investigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You walk through the village and record the ID of each program and the IDs with which it can communicate directly (your puzzle input). Each program has one or more programs with which it can communicate, and these pipes are bidirectional; if 8 says it can communicate with 11, then 11 will say it can communicate with 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to figure out how many programs are in the group that contains program ID 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you go door-to-door like a travelling salesman and record the following list:\n",
    "\n",
    "    0 <-> 2\n",
    "    1 <-> 1\n",
    "    2 <-> 0, 3, 4\n",
    "    3 <-> 2, 4\n",
    "    4 <-> 2, 3, 6\n",
    "    5 <-> 6\n",
    "    6 <-> 4, 5\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the following programs are in the group that contains program ID 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Program 0 by definition.\n",
    "    Program 2, directly connected to program 0.\n",
    "    Program 3 via program 2.\n",
    "    Program 4 via program 2.\n",
    "    Program 5 via programs 6, then 4, then 2.\n",
    "    Program 6 via programs 4, then 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a total of 6 programs are in this group; all but program 1, which has a pipe that connects it to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many programs are in the group that contains program ID 0?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part Two \n",
    "\n",
    "There are more programs than just the ones in the group containing program ID 0. The rest of them have no way of reaching that group, and still might have no way of reaching each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "A group is a collection of programs that can all communicate via pipes either directly or indirectly. The programs you identified just a moment ago are all part of the same group. Now, they would like you to determine the total number of groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, there were 2 groups: one consisting of programs 0,2,3,4,5,6, and the other consisting solely of program 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many groups are there in total?"
